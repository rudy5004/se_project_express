# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The project involves setting up a server for the “WTWR” app using Express and MongoDB, with a focus on building out an API. In the first steps, you’ll set up an Express project, configure routes, controllers, and a database, and handle errors. Linting with ESLint and hot-reloading with Nodemon are also part of the process, along with setting up project structure for routes, controllers, and models. You will use Mongoose to define schemas for users and clothing items, and implement features such as adding likes and handling errors with specific HTTP codes. Finally, you’ll test your project using Postman and GitHub Actions, ensuring it meets the necessary requirements.
